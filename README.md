# User Input Error Detection Using Recurring Neural Networks
 This is a Deep Learning project (in process) applied to the user interaction with Odoo, in order to detect potential mistakes and incoherent information inputted by a given user. Odoo is an ERP integrated system that can be modeled to satisfy virtually any business process model needs.
